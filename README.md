#Hi all! This a chatbot created using IBM's watson assistant. Here I have succesfully integrated my chatbot into  a website and then hosted it using github pages and glitch (as backup).

# All you need to do is go to integrations tab in IBM cloud, then click web chat and there!

#You get your HTML and JS code of just 4 lines. Just copy and paste it then!

#That's how the assistant will come into your webpage.

#Then design your webpage using HTML and CSS.

#The bot uses NLP and ML technologies.

#Check the source code by clicking index.html

#Thank you!
